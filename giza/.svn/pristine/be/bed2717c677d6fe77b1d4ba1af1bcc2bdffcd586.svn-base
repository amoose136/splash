Type: 

./configure
make install

You will need a C compiler, cairo and X11 development packages. If they are 
ready to go the above should build giza using gcc,
and "make install" should install under a Linux or Mac operating system.

-----
To install in a special location (e.g. your userspace), use:

./configure --prefix=${HOME}
make install

-----
If you have X11 or cairo installed in a custom location, or you don't have pkg-config installed,
specify the location with the following flags:

./configure X11_CFLAGS='-I/usr/X11/include' X11_LIBS='-L/usr/X11/lib -lX11'
            CAIRO_CFLAGS='-I/usr/X11/include/cairo' CAIRO_LIBS='-L/usr/X11/lib/cairo -lcairo'
make install

-----
You can find out more options using ./configure --help
